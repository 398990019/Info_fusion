- [x] Update README with current status and guidance.
- [ ] Diagnose why new We-MP-RSS account data is not appearing (cache/config issue).
- [ ] Resolve missing file errors (`static\wx_qrcode.png`, `data/.lock`) during We-MP-RSS launch.
- [ ] Ensure start.bat ends with frontend URL output and full service readiness.
